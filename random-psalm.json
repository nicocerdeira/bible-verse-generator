sending angels of destruction among them.</p><p>He made a path for His anger;</p><p>He did not spare their soul from death,</p><p>But gave their life over to the plague,</p><p>And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt,</p><p>The first of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p><p>But He made His own people go forth like sheep,</p><p>And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</p><p>And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear;</p><p>But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p><p>And He brought them to His holy border,</p><p>This mountain which His right hand had acquired.</p><p>He also drove out the nations before them,</p><p>Allotted them an inheritance by survey,</p><p>And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.</p><p>Yet they tested and provoked the Most High

of Shiloh,</p><p>The tent He had placed among men,</p><p>And delivered His strength into captivity,</p><p>And His glory into the enemy’s hand.</p><p>He also gave His people over to the sword,</p><p>And was furious with His inheritance.</p><p>The fire consumed their young men,</p><p>And their maidens were not given in marriage.</p><p>Their priests fell by the sword,</p><p>And their widows made no lamentation.</p><p>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,</p><p>Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.</p><p>And He beat back His enemies;</p><p>He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p><p>Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph,</p><p>And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</p><p>But chose the tribe of Judah,</p><p>Mount Zion which He loved.</p><p>And He built His sanctuary like the heights,</p><p>Like the earth which He has established forever.</p><p>He also chose David His servant,</p><p>And took him from the sheepfolds;</p><p>From following the ewes that had young He brought him,</p><p>To shepherd Jacob His people,</p><p>And Israel His inheritance.</p><p>So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart,</p><p>And guided them by the
